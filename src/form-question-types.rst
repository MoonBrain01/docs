Question Types
=================

:doc:`collect-intro` supports forms with a wide variety of question types.
The exact functionality and display style of each question
are specified in your `XLSForm`_ definition using the
:th:`type` and :th:`appearance` columns.

.. _XLSForm: http://xlsform.org

.. contents:: :depth: 1
  :local:

.. tip::

  You can find an XLSForm with all available question types `here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1af_Sl8A_L8_EULbhRLHVl8OclCfco09Hq2tqb9CslwQ/edit#gid=0>`_.

  For simpler forms you can use :doc:`build-intro`, which provides a visual, drag-and-drop interface.

.. admonition:: Helpful terminology

  .. glossary::

    question

      A prompt to the user, usually requesting a response.
      Questions are written as a single line in an XLSForm,
      and usually appear on a single screen in Collect.

    widget

      A rendered question screen in Collect.
      The :th:`type` and :th:`appearance` of a question
      determine the widget that is displayed.


.. _text-widget:

Text widgets
--------------

All of the text widgets share the :tc:`text` type,
and the inputs from them are saved as literal strings.

.. warning::

  If you are using Aggregate and expect answers to be more than 255 characters, you should :doc:`increase the database field length to over 255 characters <aggregate-field-length>`.

.. contents::

.. _text-default:

Default text widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type
  :tc:`text`
appearance
  *none*

A simple text input.

The text entry field expands as the user types, and line breaks can be included. The keyboard displayed depends on the Android device and user settings.

.. _number-text-widget:

Number text widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type
  :tc:`text`
appearance
  :tc:`numbers`


A numerical input that treats the input as a string, rather than a number.

The number input accepts numerals (``0123456789``), hyphens (``-``), and decimal points (``.``). These are the only characters available on the number keypad displayed with this widget.

This is useful for phone numbers, ID numbers, IP addresses, and similar data. It can also be used in place of the :ref:`default-integer-widget` or :ref:`default-decimal-widget` if large numbers are needed. (The integer widget has a limit of nine digits, and the decimal widget has a limit of 15 characters.)

.. _time-widget:

Time widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type
  :tc:`time`
appearance
  *none*

A time selector. Captures only a specific time-of-day, not a date and time. For date and time, see the :ref:`datetime-widget`.

The time widget does not accept any :th:`appearance` attributes.

.. note::
  :name: time-zone-note


  The time widget stores the time along with a time zone.
  This can cause unexpected behavior around `Daylight saving time`_.

  .. _Daylight saving time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time

  For example, if you record a time before the clock change,
  and then view the time after the clock change,
  it will appear to be an hour off.
  This happens because the recorded time data
  is understood as a specific moment in time
  that is being "translated" into your current, local time zone.

  A similar problem occurs when moving between geographic time zones.

  This makes the time widget unsuitable for abstract
  time-of-day questions such as *What time do you usually wake up?*
  For questions like this, you may want to use a :ref:`select-minimal`.
  You can set the options at whatever level of accuracy you need ---
  for example, 15 or 30 minute increments.
  Alternatively, you could use the select widget for hours,
  and an :ref:`default-integer-widget` for minutes.

.. _select-widgets:

Select widgets
-----------------

Select widgets offer the :term:`participant` options to pick from.
You can offer the participant
a :ref:`single choice <single-select-widget>`,
or the ability to :ref:`choose multiple answers <multi-select-widget>`. The order of the choices can be :ref:`randomized <randomize-choice-order>` for any of the select types described below. The list of choices available can also be :ref:`filtered <cascading-selects>` based on answers to previous questions.

The options for a select question are listed
on a sheet named **choices**, in your XLSForm file.
The **choices** sheet has at least three columns:

:th:`list_name`
  A set of choices for a single question share a common :th:`list_name`.
  The value of :th:`list_name` is included in the :th:`type` column
  on the **survey** sheet.

:th:`name`
  The canonical identifier for a specific choice. This value is what is stored on the completed form. If you :ref:`refer to a select response using a variable <variables>`, the :th:`name` string is returned.

  As with the **survey** sheet, :th:`name` must not include spaces.

:th:`label`
  The user-facing text displayed for the choice.

Select widgets can :ref:`include images as choices <select-columns-widget>`.

.. _image-options:

Including media files in choices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As with questions themselves, choices can include :ref:`media <media>` (image, video, or audio files):

.. csv-table:: choices
  :header: list_name, name, label, media::image, media::video, media::audio

  opt_media,a,A,a.jpg
  opt_media,b,B,,b.mp4
  opt_media,c,C,,,c.mp3

.. note::

  ``select_one`` and ``select_multiple`` questions using the ``compact`` appearances will not
  display media buttons next to choices. However, if a choice has audio, it will be played when
  the choice is selected.

.. _randomize-choice-order:

Randomizing choice order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

  Randomizing choice order support was added in Collect v1.18.2 and Aggregate v1.7.1. Form conversion requires XLSForm Online ‚â• v1.2.2 or pyxform ‚â• v0.11.6.

To reduce bias, choice order can be randomized for any of the select question types described above. To display the choices in a different order each time the question is displayed, set **randomize** to **true** in the :th:`parameters` column of the XLSForm **survey** sheet:

.. rubric:: XLSForm

.. csv-table:: survey
  :header: type, parameters, name, label

  select_one opt_abcd,randomize=true,select_one_random_widget,"Select one with random choice order set on each display"

.. csv-table:: choices
  :header: list_name, name, label

  opt_abcd,a,A
  opt_abcd,b,B
  opt_abcd,c,C
  opt_abcd,d,D

In the example above, each time the question is displayed, the choices will be in a different order. It is often preferable to pick one order that the choices will always be displayed in for a given filled form. This can be accomplished by setting an integer seed for the randomization.

.. rubric:: XLSForm

.. csv-table:: survey
  :header: type, parameters, name, label, calculation

  calculate,,my_seed,,"once(substr(decimal-date-time(now()), 10))"
  select_one opt_abcd,"randomize=true,seed=${my_seed}",select_one_widget,Select one with random choice order set once per filled form

.. csv-table:: choices
  :header: list_name, name, label

  opt_abcd,a,A
  opt_abcd,b,B
  opt_abcd,c,C
  opt_abcd,d,D

This seed can also be used to recreate the order choices were displayed in. See `the XForms spec <https://getodk.github.io/xforms-spec/#fn:randomize>`_ for a description of the randomization algorithm used.

.. note::

  In the example above, the integer seed is created from the last 8 numbers of the :func:`decimal-date-time()` which is unlikely to repeat across devices. In the seed expression, :func:`once` is important because it makes sure the seed is not changed if the same filled form is opened more than once.

.. _or-other:

Including "other" as a choice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the **survey** sheet, in the :th:`type` column,
after the type and the list_name,
you can add :tc:`or_other`.
This will add "Other" as an additional option to your choice list.
The :th:`name` value of the choice when selected will be :tc:`other`.


.. _rank-widget:

Rank widget
-----------------

The rank widget allows the user to order options from a list. The value saved in the form and sent to the server is a space-separated ordered list of the options.

Like with :ref:`select-widgets`, the options are listed on a sheet named **choices** in an XLSForm.

To change the order of the options in the list, tap the :guilabel:`Rank items` button. In the resulting dialog, long press on an item and once it gets a border around it, drag it up or down to change the order. If no :ref:`default <default-responses>` is provided, the value for the question is blank until the user taps :guilabel:`OK` in the ranking dialog.

.. _location-widgets:

Location widgets
------------------

Location widgets capture one or more points representing locations on Earth. Each point is represented as four numbers separated by spaces: latitude, longitude, altitude in meters, and accuracy radius in meters.

For example, if a Collect user captured a point while at the coordinates 12¬∞22'17.0"N 1¬∞31'10.9"W, with a reported accuracy radius of 17.4 meters, and at 305 meters above sea level, the geopoint representation would be:

`12.371400 -1.519700 305 17.4`

Multiple points that form lines or shapes are separated by semicolons.

.. note::

  The accuracy radius is an estimate of what Android calls the `radius of 68% confidence <https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location.html#getAccuracy()>`_: there is a 68% chance that the true location falls within this radius. This is an estimate reported by the Android system based on the available sensors (GPS, network, etc). The accuracy radius itself may be more or less reliable depending on the sensor(s) used and current conditions. Learn more about getting more accurate locations :doc:`here <collect-location>`.

.. note::

  since v1.30, when a mock location provider is detected, the accuracy is set to 0. Achieving such perfect accuracy is not possible using GPS so that indicates it comes from a mock provider.

.. _geopoint-widget:

Geopoint widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type
  :tc:`geopoint`
appearance
  *none*

Captures the current geolocation from the device.

For a geopoint with a user-selected location,
see :ref:`placement-map-widget`

.. tip::

  .. versionadded:: 1.15

  While determining the current coordinates,
  you will see a dialog box displaying:

  - Number of satellites found
  - Elapsed time

  To get an accurate fix on your location,
  the device must find at least four (4) satellites.
  If the device can not find at least four satellites,
  make sure there is nothing obstructing the device's view of the sky.

  If you have problems with the geopoint widget,
  be sure to note the elapsed time
  and accuracy (if applicable),
  so that you can share it with your support staff
  or with the |forum|_.

.. image:: /img/form-widgets/default-geopoint.*

.. _geopoint-maps:

Geopoint with map display
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

type
  :tc:`geopoint`
appearance
  :tc:`maps`

The default :ref:`geopoint-widget` does not display a map to the user. When the appearance attribute is :tc:`maps`, the widget displays a map to help the user get oriented and confirm that the selected point is correct and sufficiently accurate.

When the device's geolocation is available, it is displayed on the map by a blue cross. A blue shaded circle around the cross represents the accuracy radius of the geolocation. The "add marker" button at the top right of the screen can be tapped to add a point at the location indicated by the middle of the blue cross. The selected point is represented by a small circle with a red outline.

When the map view is opened again with a selected point, the map is centered on that point. To change the selection, first tap the "trash" icon and then select a new point.

For a geopoint with a location that the user can manually select or adjust, see :ref:`placement-map-widget`.

Geopoint with user-selected location
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

type
  :tc:`geopoint`
appearance
  :tc:`placement-map`

The default :ref:`geopoint-widget` does not allow the user to place the point anywhere other than the device's current geolocation.

A geopoint with the appearance attribute :tc:`placement-map` allows the user to select any point from a map. The user can either long press to place the point anywhere, or, if the device knows its geolocation, tap on the "add point" button at the top right of the screen. The selected point is represented by a small circle with a red outline (see arrow in screenshot).

The save button saves the selected point and returns to the question screen. If the point was selected by long pressing, the accuracy radius and altitude will both be 0. If the device's geolocation was selected, the accuracy radius will be greater than 0.

When the map view is opened again with an existing point, the map is centered on the selected point. To change the selection, first tap the "trash" icon and then select a new point.

.. image:: /img/form-widgets/geopoint-placement-map.*
  :alt: A map opens on an Android phone. Above the map is the message: "Long press to place mark or tap add marker button."

.. _geotrace-widget:

Geotrace widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type
  :tc:`geotrace`
appearance
  *none*

A series of points. Identical to :ref:`geoshape <geoshape-widget>` except that the first and last point may be different and at least 2 points are required.

Points can be entered either by tapping the screen to place each point, or by taking readings of the device's geolocation over time. On a map, each coordinate is represented by small circles with red outlines. These are connected by red lines.

To collect a geotrace, first select the location-recording mode by tapping the "add point" button in the upper right side of the screen. The selected mode will be displayed in the gray bar at the bottom of the screen. While point collection is ongoing, the "add marker" button changes to a "pause" button. The "back arrow" button can be used to remove the last-entered point either when actively collecting points or when paused. Any point can be manually moved at any time by tapping on it and dragging it. The mode can only be changed if an existing line is first cleared by tapping the "trash" button. Recording must be paused to clear the existing line.

.. tip::
  Points that were entered by tapping or adjusted by dragging will always have an accuracy radius of 0. Points that were read from the device location will never have an accuracy radius of 0.

Once the trace has been saved, the coordinates of its points will be displayed on the question screen. The trace can be opened for manual editing by tapping to add more points, moving existing points or deleting the last-added point. After a trace has been saved once, it cannot be added to in manual or automatic location recording modes.

The three location recording modes are:

Placement by tapping
  The user taps the device to place points.

Manual location recording
  The user chooses when to tap the "record a point" button at the top of the screen to capture the device geolocation at that moment.

Automatic location recording
  The user is prompted to select a recording interval and accuracy requirement. If the accuracy requirement is set to None, points are always collected at the recording interval. If the accuracy requirement is set to any other value, a point will only be captured if it meets the requirement. For example, given a recording interval of 20s and an accuracy requirement of 10m, the app places a point at the device location every 20s if the location is accurate to 10m or better.

.. warning::

  If you are using Aggregate and you would like to collect more than 5 points at a time, you should :doc:`increase the database field length to over 255 characters <aggregate-field-length>`. Otherwise, additional points will be lost.

~~~~~~~~~

type
  :tc:`geoshape`
appearance
  *none*

A series of points that form a closed polygon. Identical to :ref:`geotrace <geotrace-widget>` except that the first and last point are always the same and at least 3 points are required.

Points can be entered either by tapping the screen to place each point, or by taking readings of the device's geolocation over time. On a map, each coordinate is represented by small circles with red outlines. These are connected by red lines.

To collect a geoshape, first select the location-recording mode by tapping the "add point" button in the upper right side of the screen. The selected mode will be displayed in the gray bar at the bottom of the screen. While point collection is ongoing, the "add marker" button changes to a "pause" button. The "back arrow" button can be used to remove the last-entered point either when actively collecting points or when paused. Any point can be manually moved at any time by tapping on it and dragging it. The mode can only be changed if an existing line is first cleared by tapping the "trash" button. Recording must be paused to clear the existing line.

.. tip::
  Points that were entered by tapping or adjusted by dragging will always have an accuracy radius of 0. Points that were read from the device location will never have an accuracy radius of 0.

Once the shape has been saved, the coordinates of its points will be displayed on the question screen. The shape can be opened for manual editing by tapping to add more points, moving existing points or deleting the last-added point. After a shape has been saved once, it cannot be added to in manual or automatic location recording modes.

The three location recording modes are:

Placement by tapping
  The user taps the device to place points.

Manual location recording
  The user chooses when to tap the "record a point" button at the top of the screen to capture the device geolocation at that moment.

Scaling down images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Images created with any of the image widgets described above can be automatically scaled down on save by using the ``max-pixels`` parameter. If the long edge of the image is larger than the maximum size specified, the image is resized proportionally so that the long edge matches the provided pixel value. This is useful to reduce the upload size when bandwidth is limited.

Available in Collect since v1.10.0 and in XLSForm since 7/2018.

.. rubric:: XLSForm

In the parameters column, write ``max-pixels=`` followed by the desired maximum length of the long edge in pixels.

.. _audio:

Audio widget
----------------

.. contents::
 :local:

Default audio widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type
  :tc:`audio`
appearance
  :tc:`none`

Records audio using the device's microphone or a connected external microphone. By default, an :ref:`external application <external-audio-app>` is used. Starting with Collect v1.29, you can also use :ref:`built-in recording <built-in-audio-recording>`.

.. image:: /img/form-widgets/audio-start.*
  :alt: The Audio form widget as displayed in the ODK Collect App on an Android phone. The question text is "What does it sound like?" There are two buttons: Record Sound and Choose Sound.

.. rubric:: XLSForm

.. csv-table:: survey
  :header: type, name, label

  audio, bird_recording, What does it sound like?

.. tip::

  Audio files can be very large so if you record audio in your form, make sure that you consider your audio quality settings. Also, consider making test submissions to your server with the Internet conditions you expect when gathering data to make sure that you can send files of the size you expect.

  Android devices can make many sounds during use and these will be included in recordings. We recommend turning off sounds from button presses, camera shutters and notifications before recording.

.. _built-in-audio-recording:

Using the built-in audio recorder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 1.29

  `ODK Collect v1.29.0 <https://github.com/getodk/collect/releases/tag/v1.29.0>`_

The built-in audio recorder makes it possible to capture audio without having to install an external app. It also enables recording while filling out other questions and is designed to continue recording even if the user switches to another app or if the phone screen is locked. To use the built-in audio recorder, :ref:`specify the desired audio quality <customizing-audio-quality>` for each audio question in your form. You can also :ref:`configure Collect to always use the built-in recorder <use-external-app-for-audio-recording>`.

.. image:: /img/form-widgets/built-in-recorder.*
  :alt: The built-in recorder as displayed in the ODK Collect App on an Android phone. The user interface is described below.

When built-in audio recording is enabled and recording is initiated, a recording control bar appears at at the top of the screen. At the top left of this bar is an icon to represent whether recording is currently ongoing or paused (1). To the right of this icon is the current length of the recording (2).

.. warning::

  Pause is only available on Android 7.0 and above. On lower Android versions, the pause button is hidden.

At the right of the control bar are a pause button (3) and a stop button (4). When the pause button is tapped, recording is temporarily suspended and the button icon changes to a microphone. When the microphone is tapped, recording is resumed. Recording can be paused and resumed as many times as desired. When the stop button is tapped, the recording is ended and can no longer be modified.

Recording status is also displayed below the audio question text. There is a time representing the current length of the recording (5) and a diagram (6) representing the volume of the recording over time. The diagram provides confirmation that the microphone is working and can help a user ensure an even, sufficient volume.

Other questions can be included on the same screen as a built-in recording question. As shown in the screenshot above, this makes it possible to capture quantitative content while recording. To achieve this, put the questions in a :ref:`field list <field-list>`.

During recording, the user is prevented from leaving the current question screen. However, it is safe to use other applications or to lock the device screen.

Once recording is stopped, the control bar disappears. The recording is made available for playback below the question text.

To replace the audio captured, first delete the current file and then record again.

In some rare cases such as the device running out of space, the recording may complete successfully but not be attached to the form. If this happens, a dialog will be displayed explaining that the file is available but needs to be accessed manually. You can find these files in the ``recordings`` folder of the :ref:`Collect directory <collect-directory>`. This folder is never cleared so consider emptying it yourself once you have retrieved its files.

.. _customizing-audio-quality:

Customizing audio quality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 1.29

  `ODK Collect v1.29.0 <https://github.com/getodk/collect/releases/tag/v1.29.0>`_, `pyxform` v1.3.0, `XLSForm Online` v2.3.0

The quality of audio recordings can be customized using the ``quality`` parameter. If a ``quality`` is specified, the built-in recorder is always used, regardless of Collect settings. If no ``quality`` is specified and Collect is :ref:`configured to use the built-in recorder <use-external-app-for-audio-recording>`, ``normal`` is used. The available quality values are:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Value
     - Extension
     - Encoding
     - Bit rate
     - Sample rate
     - File size
   * - normal
     - .m4a
     - AAC
     - 64kbps
     - 32kHz
     - ~30MB/hour
   * - low
     - .m4a
     - AAC
     - 24kbps

     - ~11MB/hour
   * - voice-only
     - .amr
     - AMR
     - 12.2kbps
     - 8kHz
     - ~5MB/hour

.. tip::

  We'd recommend only using ``voice-only`` for one-on-one interviews in a quiet place as otherwise there might be too much detail loss. ``low`` will sound compressed but speech is generally intelligible, even if multiple people are talking at once. ``normal`` is similar to typical podcast settings and will sound good on most devices.

  It's a good idea to test the different qualities out with the device (and any other equipment) you'll be using in the field to see which one fits your use case and setup best.

.. rubric:: XLSForm

In the parameters column, write ``quality=`` followed by the desired value.

.. csv-table:: survey
 :header: type, name, label, parameters

 audio,voice_only_audio,Voice audio,quality=voice-only

Changing audio quality during form entry
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If it's a possibility that an individual question could need different qualities depending on context you can use :ref:`relevance <relevants>` to switch between them:

.. rubric:: XLSForm

.. csv-table:: survey
  :header: type, name, label, parameters, relevance

  select_one yes_no, is_quiet, Are you currently in a quiet location with only one person speaking at a time?

  audio, recording_voice_only, Please record, quality=voice-only, ${is_quiet} = 'yes'
  audio, recording_normal, Please record, quality=normal, ${is_quiet} = 'no'

.. csv-table:: choices
  :header: list_name, name, label

  yes_no, yes, Yes
  yes_no, no, No

.. _external-audio-app:

Recording with an external app
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting ``quality`` to ``external`` will use an external app to record audio rather than use Collect's built in recording features. Some Android devices provide a default application for audio recording. Others do not, and the user will need to install an audio recording app.

There are many apps available for this, including:

- `Axet Audio Recorder (open source) <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.axet.audiorecorder>`_
- `RecForge II <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dje073.android.modernrecforge>`_

Any app that responds to
``android.provider.MediaStore.Audio.Media.RECORD_SOUND_ACTION``
will be compatible.


.. _external-app-audio-widget:

  :alt: A field-list group of questions, as displayed in the ODK Collect app on an Android phone. A grid of questions representing underlying conditions are displayed. For eacn condition, there are radio buttons to indicate 'Yes' or 'No'.


To do this, put your select questions in a :tc:`field-list` group and use the following :th:`appearance` attributes:

:tc:`label`
  Only the option labels are displayed, without checkboxes. This is used for the top row with the 'Yes' and 'No' options in the example above.
:tc:`list-nolabel`
  Only checkboxes or radio buttons are displayed, without their labels. This is used for the question rows in the example above.
:tc:`list`
  The labels are displayed along with checkboxes for multi-select questions and radio buttons for single-select questions. You could use this instead of having a :tc:`label` row to keep the option labels closer to the checkboxes or radio buttons.

Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~

Metadata questions capture information about the device or a survey collection event and are not visible to the user.

A more complete record of user behavior within a form can be generated by enabling :doc:`form audit logging <form-audit-log>`.

These items are dependent on the survey collection event:

- :tc:`start` --- The datetime the survey was started in ISO 8601 format (e.g., 2019-09-27T09:45:10.854-07:00).
- :tc:`end` --- The last datetime the survey was saved in ISO 8601 format.
- :tc:`today` --- The date the survey was started in ISO 8601 format (e.g, 2019-09-27).
- :tc:`start-geopoint` --- The geolocation when the survey was started. :ref:`Read more <metadata-start-geopoint>`.

This item is defined at installation time and cannot be changed:

- :tc:`deviceid`

These items are defined in Collect,
and :ref:`can be edited in Settings <form-metadata-settings>`:

- :tc:`username`
- :tc:`phonenumber`

Geolocation at survey start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. seealso::
  :ref:`Audit log geolocation tracking <audit-geolocation-tracking>`

.. note::
  Geolocation at survey start was added in Collect v1.23 and Aggregate v2.0.4/v1.7.4. Form conversion requires XLSForm Online ‚â• v1.6.1 or pyxform ‚â• v0.15.1.

The :tc:`start-geopoint` question type is used to capture a single geolocation in :ref:`geopoint format <location-widgets>` when the survey is first started. Questions of type :tc:`start-geopoint` may be given any allowable name. Although it is possible to have more than one :tc:`start-geopoint` question in a form, all will have the same value.

Any time a survey with a `start-geopoint` question is opened in Collect, the enumerator will see a warning that the form tracks device location. If the device battery is low, or if location tracking needs to be turned off for any reason, you can tap :menuselection:`‚ãÆ --> Track location` or turn off location providers in Android.

The first time that a survey with a `start-geopoint` question is opened, Collect will attempt to read the device's geolocation. The geolocation reading with the highest accuracy received in a 20-second window will be recorded. A location icon will be displayed in the Android status bar while the geolocation is being requested by Collect.

Geolocation is read using data from GPS, WiFi and possibly other signals so this feature should work in most environments.

If geolocation information is unavailable, the question will be left blank. Reasons for a blank value may include the enumerator turning off location providers, Collect not having location permissions, Google Play Services not being installed, the GPS not having satellite lock and more. No troubleshooting information is provided in the form submission.

Including a `start-geopoint` question may make it faster to get high-accuracy geolocation readings for other :ref:`location question types <location-widgets>` by "warming" the GPS.

  background-audio, my_recording

When a form includes a question of type :tc:`background-audio`, audio is recorded while the form is open and attached to the form submission as a single audio file. These recordings can be used for quality assurance, training, transcription, and more. Use background recording instead of an :ref:`audio question <customizing-audio-quality>` when you want to make sure to record everything that happens during form filling.

By default, audio files will be saved in the `amr` format with a bitrate of 12.2kbps and a sample rate of 8kHz, resulting in a file size of about 5MB per hour. These settings correspond to the ``voice-only`` quality :ref:`for audio questions <customizing-audio-quality>` and minimize file size while maintaining reasonable quality for a conversation between two people. You can override that default quality by specifying a value in the :th:`parameters` column as described :ref:`for audio questions <customizing-audio-quality>`.

Planning for background audio recording
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Before adding background audio recording to your form, make sure that you have a plan for following local laws around audio recording. We generally recommend including a note at the beginning of the form to remind data collectors and participants that they are being recorded and to describe the purpose of the recording. Depending on the context, you may be required to ask for the consent of every person in speaking range of the microphone.

Additionally, you should make a plan for using the resulting audio files. Do you have someone who can listen to and make sense of many audio files? Could you get access to speech-to-text capabilities? Also consider whether your data collectors will be able to send audio files. Will they have access to a fast enough Internet connection? Will their Internet plan or number of credits allow them to send all the audio files you expect?

It can be helpful to combine background audio recording with :doc:`audit logging <form-audit-log>` to have more context while listening to the recording. Recording starts at the ``form start`` and ``form resume`` events and stops at the ``form exit`` event. You can use the difference between the ``form start`` time and the start time of an event to identify how far into the background recording a certain event happened.

Background audio recording user interface
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

While recording is ongoing, an audio status bar is shown at the top of the screen. This bar helps remind data collectors that they are being recorded and provides visual feedback about audio volume. 

If a data collector exits a form and then re-opens it for editing, audio recording is resumed. Audio recording continues as long as the form is open, even if another application is in the foreground or the screen is locked. Note that Collect settings can't be accessed directly from a form that has background recording. The audio file sent to the server will include audio from every time that the form was opened for editing.

.. tip::

  Android devices can make many sounds during use and these will be included in recordings. We recommend turning off sounds from button presses, camera shutters and notifications before recording.

There is an override available to data collectors when recording might compromise safety or when consent to record can't be obtained but it's still important to capture some data. When the audio recording option is unchecked, audio recording ends immediately and any previously-recorded audio is deleted. Recording can't be resumed during the current form-filling session. Toggling the audio recording option back on indicates that the next form filling session should be recorded. If :doc:`audit logging <form-audit-log>` is enabled, a ``background audio disabled`` event will be logged if a data collector toggles off recording and a ``background audio enabled`` event will be logged if a data collector toggles it back on.

Background audio recording troubleshooting
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In some rare cases such as the device running out of space, the recording may complete successfully but not be attached to the form. If this happens, the recording may be available in the ``recordings`` folder of the :ref:`Collect directory <collect-directory>`. This folder is never cleared so consider emptying it yourself once you have retrieved its files.
